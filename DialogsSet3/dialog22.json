GERD is a condition in which stomach acid and other contents of the stomach reflux back up into the esophagus. This can cause a burning sensation in the chest or throat. Other symptoms of GERD may include difficulty swallowing, coughing, and wheezing. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, I recommend that you see a doctor for further evaluation."
