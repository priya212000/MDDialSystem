This condition can be caused by a number of factors, such as eating spicy or fatty foods, lying down after eating, or wearing tight clothing that puts pressure on the stomach. Treatment for acid reflux typically includes lifestyle changes, such as avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller meals, and avoiding eating before bedtime. In some cases, medication may also be necessary to manage the symptoms of acid reflux."}
