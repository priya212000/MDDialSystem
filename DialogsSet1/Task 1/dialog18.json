Some potential causes include acid reflux, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a digestive tract infection, eating too quickly, or consuming spicy or carbonated beverages. If your hiccups are accompanied by other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or weight loss, it's important to seek medical attention right away as these could be signs of a more serious condition."
