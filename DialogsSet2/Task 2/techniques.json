      "explaination": "This technique is from the Least-to-Most prompting technique. It is implemented through two stage prompting: reducing a complex problem into a list of subproblems, and then sequentially solving these subproblems, whereby solving a given subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems.",
